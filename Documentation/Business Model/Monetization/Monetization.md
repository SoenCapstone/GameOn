### Launch Strategy

The app will initially focus on 2–3 leagues, such as soccer, hockey, and basketball, running short 4–6 week seasons. Private league sections will be free to use during this initial phase. New users and league admins will be recruited through campus channels and promoted across various social media platforms to maximize early adoption.

To maintain engagement and retention, the app will implement a reward system. Users can earn reliability badges, fee credits for attending games, and bonuses for inviting friends. Additionally, the app will support cross-team substitutions within the same night or venue to densify the marketplace and encourage more frequent usage. 

## Monetary Projections

The revenue model is based on several user types and subscription structures:\

- Private League Admins: Completely free

- Public League Admins: Receive 10 free games in the public spaces to try the feature, after which they pay a monthly fee ($15/month) for continued use.

- Private Teams: Free for a set number of players, with a flat fee ($5) applied once the limit is exceeded.

- Public Teams: Pay a monthly fee ($10/month) to appear in public spaces.
