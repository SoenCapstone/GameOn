# Context
Different types of amateur or semi-professional sport leagues consistently face organizational challenges that can cause problems in therms of  the player engagement, the game flow and the efficiency of administration work. Some examples are:
* Absences that are last minute, which leaves teams struggling to find substitute players on time. 
* Conflict of schedule between the venues and the teams playing, which requires a lot of coordination that tedious and manual.
* Payment handling that is fragmented, which is often spread across systems like e-transfer, cash and reminders that are informal.

The league management applications currently in the market (like PlayPass, LeagueRepublic and TeamSnap) only tackles partial aspects of the process (mostly communication or scheduling), but none of them give an unified and automated system that takes care of rosters, scheduling and real-time substitution under one multi-sport platform.

# Motivation
The GameOn app wants to unify and automate operations of amateur leagues with a mobile-first platform that is envisioned for players, coaches and players. This project gives an answer to existing tools that are fragmented by:
* Allowing management across different sports (like soccer, basketball, volleyball, hockey and so on) by utilizing templates that are configurable. 
* Putting in place a real-time substitution system, which allows substitutes to be filled automatically when there is an open roster slot.
* Giving integrated payments and tracking of attendance, which reduces the burden of administrative work and the handling of cash.
* Allowing communication and notifications inside the app, which is contextualized to events or seasons.

This approach to the GameOn app puts it as a productivity enhancer for organizers, coaches and players by bridging the gap between technology and sports management.

# Prior Research and Competitive Landscape
A comparison review of existing shows their limitations:
* PlayPass gives more attention to scheduling tournaments, which lacks the management of replacements and communication.
* LeagueRepublic gives a web interface for different sports, but there is minimal interactivity for players (there is no RSVP or live substitution system).
* TeamSnap is adapted widely, but it is missing automation in substitution, analytics and conflict-aware scheduling.

These findings shows that there is a clear gap for an application that focuses on automation, context-aware communication and metrics that are data driven. This is a gap that GamOn wants to fill.

# Technological and Market Relevance
The GameOn app aligns itself with the growing digital transformation in sports management apps, where league organizers rely more and more on mobile coordination tools.
GameOn differentiates itself with:
* A substitution system that is ranked witch matching skills and positions
* An attendance aware payment system, which is linked to participation
* a cross-sport template, which allows administrators with the reconfiguration of rules and scoring immediately. 

These kinds of innovations allows the enhancement of operational reliability of small to medium sized leagues, while taking care of inclusivity and engagement in different sport communities.
